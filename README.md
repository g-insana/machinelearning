# machinelearning

This repository holds the code and the reports for the final projects of the six courses of the [IBM ML specialization](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning)

Code and reports written by <a href='https://insana.net'>Giuseppe Insana</a> between 2021.12.04 and 2022.03.18

The six courses, with coursera links, were:
1. [Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-exploratory-data-analysis-for-machine-learning)
2. [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-machine-learning-regression)
3. [Supervised Machine Learning: Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-machine-learning-classification)
4. [Unsupervised Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-unsupervised-machine-learning)
5. [Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-reinforcement-learning)
6. [Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/time-series-survival-analysis)
